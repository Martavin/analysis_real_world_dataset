# Digits That Matter - Binary Classifier Deep Dive

In this project, I will build a Binary Classifier that determines if an image is the digit 3 from the MNIST dataset. The dataset is avaible online and contanins 784 features and can be split into two, a training set (first 60,000) and testing set (10,000)

## Project Overview
This is a data science project that uses a real world dataset to anayze the perfomacne of a Binary Classiser
-Data loading and description
- Model training
- Building a Binary classifer
- Model Evalution

The goal is to build a binary classifier that examinies if an image is the digit 3

## Skills Demonstrated 
- Data analysis using **sklearn**
- Machine learning using **scikit-learn**
- Data Handling using **binary Classification**
- Model Evaluation **Confusion Matrix and ROC curve**
- Visulization using **matplotlib**
- Writing clean code using Python

## Dataset

The dataset is known as "Model National Institute of Standards and Technolgy" (MNIST) and includes 70,000 pixel images and is split into a 10,0000 testing set and 60,0000 taining set.
